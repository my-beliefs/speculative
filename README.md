Some musings and speculations

## Cazzo di Dio
I believe that on the coming June 21st of 2020 we will hopefully get to witness the onset of this "Christly" event that is likely to last for melania. Will anything grand or special happen on that day? Merely a cosmological event of a total solar eclipse is to happen and people who have various scientific speculations or superstitious speculations will undoubtedly cause a cascade of news worthy acts during the current covid pandemic. This astronomically magnificent event is coincidentally ushering in the movement of our solar system into a part of the Milkyway Galaxy where Earth will not be as shielded by cosmological radiation from the centre of the galaxy as it used to be for thousands of years. This cosmological event is merely a natural phenomenon of our sun's movement across the galaxy. The various celestial bodies and clouds of gasses between the galactic center and the Earth reduced the unpredictable effects of cosmic radiation on Earth's ecology. With deteriorated ozone layer and an unpredictable shift in Earth's magnetic field the chances that we will see natural phenomena that has never been recorded in human history is rather high and very rationally palpable.
