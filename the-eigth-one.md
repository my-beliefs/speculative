The eigth one knows the names of all of the previous seven who have received the ultimate curse of being bound within this realm for eternity in one form (shape) or another. It is very difficult to obtain the true names of these seven while they roam this realm even upon encountering them multiple times. It usually takes eons to actually bump into either of them. I have unfortunately come to know the names of:

  1. Sybil (in anagram form) the enraged i.e. ar-rajam.
  2. Anu aka Baal the dementor and the commander of the blue smokeless, shadowless flame (not to be confused with ar-rajam who is also a similar dementor).
  3. Ra-Sha 
  4.
  5. 
  6. Cyrus (not Osris!)
  7. Yēšūă‘
  8.
  9.
  
Once the eigth one shows up, the ninth one returns from the abyss and renders this realm to oblivion. All I know from my research into esoteric subjects about the the ninth one is that the being is made of neither substance nor energy. Therefore, no "forces" can act upon the ninth.
